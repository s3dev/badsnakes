Important
=========
Important things that should be noted and remembered.

- ppk's testing functionality must be moved into this library for
  entralised analysis.
- ppk must be updated to use this library for its tests.

Indicators
==========
These are malware indicators the library should use for detecting malware
or suspect code.

- pypi: no github link
- pypi: user with only 1 project
- pypi: newly created user
- pypi: use the vulerabilities key in the JSON
- code: compare against blacklisted strings
- code: high percentage of long lines
- code: use of semi-colons
- code: use of __import__
- code: use of __builtins__
- code: can very long strings (b64) be detected?

Notes
=====
General notes and ideas regarding the functionality or techniques to be
used.

- comments should be excluded from the analysis
- only search plain text files
- can dis be used to interact with the bytecode?
- can the inspect module be used to parse the code?
- report the severity of the detection: display the findings
- when detecting if a file is plaintext or binary, only read the
  first N bytes.


Capabilities
============
The library should be capable of the following.

- installed library
  - analysing a wheel file
  - analysing a pickle file 
- command line interface
  - analysing a wheel file
  - analysing a pickle file
